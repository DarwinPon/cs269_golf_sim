Hole-in-One is a 2D simulation game where two players compete by trying to launch their ball into a hole. Each player is represented as a golf ball, and their main objective is to traverse through a level filled with obstacles, and interactable terrains, and items in order to reach the goal. 
2. Gameplay  
    2.1 Gameplay loop

At the start of the game, the two players are placedin their initial position, and a goal, represented as a circular area, will appear on the other side of the leve. At the start of each turn, a player can choose to use an item in their inventory and then select a direction and the amount of force applied to launch their ball. After a player launches their ball, the controls are passed to the other player.
